<p style="color:brown;"> As a follow up on ACRONYM’s Lunar Force 1, the German technical brand led by Canadian designer Errolson Hugh once again takes on the Air Force 1, arriving in the form of the high-top Air Force 1 Downtown. Tactical details run throughout, including a milspec strap closure, and militaristic branding, while quality leather lofts up the design. Three total colorways were made available as part of a limited NikeLab release.
