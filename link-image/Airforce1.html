<p style="color:brown;"> As a follow up on ACRONYMâ€™s Lunar Force 1, the German technical brand led by Canadian designer Errolson Hugh once again takes on the Air Force 1, arriving in the form of the high-top Air Force 1 Downtown. Tactical details run throughout, including a milspec strap closure, and militaristic branding, while quality leather lofts up the design. Three total colorways were made available as part of a limited NikeLab release.
