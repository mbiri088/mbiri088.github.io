<p style="color:brown;"> 
Vault by Vans joined forces with Stockholm menswear brand Our Legacy for a collaborative capsule that drew inspiration from California hardcore punk culture. Classic sneaker silhouettes like the Half Cab, Sk8-Mid, Old Skool and Authentic were imagined in bold orange, black and white color schemes. The elevated footwear offerings were also complimented by an apparel range in matching tones.
