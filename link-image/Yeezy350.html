<p style="color:brown;"> If the YEEZY Boost craze wasn’t big enough already, another rendition of the shoe sure added fuel to the fire. Colloquially named the “Zebra V2” by sneakerheads on the internet, this striped, black and white version did bear a certain resemblance to the African horse-donkey, but wasn’t explicitly named as such by adidas. Rather than being sold at the usual adidas stockists, the release was limited to adidas Originals stores and from adidas online, driving resale prices through the roof, and leading people to believe this was the most limited V2 yet.
