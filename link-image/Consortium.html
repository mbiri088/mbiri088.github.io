<p style="color:brown;"> The Superstar is one of the most classic shoes in adidas’ catalog, and when the German sportswear brand added its touted Boost technology, the refreshed silhouette instantly became a contender for sneaker of the year. Social Status and Sneakernstuff were brought on to introduce the silhouette as part of Consortium’s Sneaker Exchange program.
