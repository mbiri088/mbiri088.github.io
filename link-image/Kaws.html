<p style="color:brown;"> 
Perhaps the most momentous Jordan news since the Nike sub-brand’s Supreme collaboration in 2015, legendary graffiti artist Brian “KAWS” Donnelly served up his own take on the IV. The resulting sneaker is bare of any traditional plastic details, and instead is entirely comprised of premium grey suede, right down to the cage. The pared-down color scheme pays homage to KAWS’ Companion characters, and is finished with a glow-in-the-dark outsole. Naturally, KAWS’ “XX” is featured boldly on the heel in place of Jordan’s classic “Air” marking.
