At a New York Fashion Week event in 2016, West was spotted wearing a pair of “Calabasas” branded adidas Powerphase sneakers. Fast forward to March 2017, and the sneakers officially released for $120 along with the full Calabasas range, which included a crewneck sweater, sweatpants, socks and a dad cap. The sneakers feature a Reebok-esque ’80s sportswear aesthetic, with gold printing on the side.
