<p style="color:brown;"> 
In the beginning of March, Supreme and Vans reprised their ongoing collaboration for 2017, dropping a collaborative Vans Sk8-Mid Pro. The New York brand added an unexpected twist to the silhouette, in the form of a velvet leopard upper with embroidered logo on the heel. As we can expect from any limited footwear drop from Supreme, these flew off shelves in seconds.
